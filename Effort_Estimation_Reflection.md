## Project Effort Estimation and Tracking Reflection  
**Name:** Yueming Guo  
**Course:** IDPM Software Engineering  
**Milestones:** M1, M2, M3

### Estimating Effort: Learning as I Go

Looking back at Milestones 1 through 3, my approach to estimating effort changed a lot as I gained more experience.

- In **M1**, I was just getting started. I wasn’t familiar with the tech stack yet, so I mostly guessed how long things would take. Unsurprisingly, my estimates were often too short because I didn’t really know what I was getting into.
- In **M2**, things got smoother. I had a better handle on the tools and the structure of the project, and I could look at past tasks to make better guesses.
- In **M3**, we brought in Supabase, and I ran into another learning curve. I underestimated how much time I’d need to understand it properly, so again, things took longer than I thought.

### Why Estimating Still Helps (Even When You're Wrong)

Even though my estimates weren’t always accurate, I still found them useful.

- In **M1**, estimating helped me break tasks down and get a clearer picture of what needed to be done.
- In **M2**, it helped with planning and communicating with my team—we could see roughly how much could fit into a sprint.
- In **M3**, the act of estimating made me realize which areas I needed to spend more time learning.

So even if the time was off, the process of estimating kept me organized and focused.

### What I Learned from Tracking My Time

Tracking the actual time I spent on tasks turned out to be super helpful. It gave me insight into:

- Which tasks were more time-consuming than I expected (like setting up Supabase)
- Where I was spending most of my energy—coding vs. debugging vs. researching
- How accurate my estimates were compared to reality

There weren’t really any downsides. The only thing that got tricky sometimes was remembering to track when I got interrupted or switched tasks suddenly.

### How I Tracked My Work

I used a mix of tools to keep track of my effort:

- A stopwatch for focused coding sessions
- Notes for estimating time spent on research, design, or meetings
- Later on, I also looked back at my commit history and GitHub issue updates to cross-check

I’d say by **M2** and **M3**, my tracking was pretty accurate—usually within 5 to 10 minutes of actual time.

### Was It a Pain to Track Time?

At first? Kind of. During **M1**, it felt like one more thing to remember.

But once I got into the habit, it was easy. Just hit "start" when I began a task and "stop" when I took a break or changed focus. It actually helped me notice when I was getting distracted and made me more intentional about my time. By the end of **M3**, it felt completely natural and didn’t slow me down at all.

### Final Thoughts

- **M1:** I was guessing most of the time and often underestimated effort.
- **M2:** I got more accurate thanks to experience and better planning.
- **M3:** I underestimated again—this time because I didn’t know Supabase well.

Even with all the ups and downs, both estimating and tracking helped me a lot. They made me more aware of how I work, where I get stuck, and what I can improve. And most importantly, they helped me communicate better and contribute more reliably to the team.
