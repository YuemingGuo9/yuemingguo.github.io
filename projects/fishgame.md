This fishing game is the last project developed by KCC campus using ICS 211 Java. It is a two player game where each player will have 12 opportunities to fish using different methods. Some methods are not allowed in specific seasons, and rules can be printed before each fishing start. Some caught fish are too small to fit into the bag, so it is necessary to decide whether to put the fish in the bag or let them leave each time. Players who use illegal fishing methods or put illegal fish in the bag will lose the game after 3 times, and after 12 times, the player with the higher total length will win. There are three people in my team responsible for classifying fish.
