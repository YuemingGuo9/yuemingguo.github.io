## Effort Estimation and Tracking Technical Essay  
**Name:** Yueming Guo  
**Course:** IDPM Software Engineering  
**Milestones:** M1, M2, M3  

---

### 1. How did you estimate your effort?

Throughout M1 to M3, I used a combination of “Compare stop-end time,” stopwatch, and historical references from previous issues.  
- In **M1**, I had almost no direction and was unfamiliar with the tech stack, so my estimates were speculative and often too short.  
- In **M2**, I became more comfortable with the project structure and tools. I could refer to similar past issues to improve accuracy.  
- In **M3**, we integrated Supabase, and I underestimated the learning curve. I realized I was not familiar enough with Supabase and Prisma, which led to actual time being longer than estimated again.

### 2. Even though your estimates are always biased, sometimes very off, is there any value in making effort estimates up front?

Yes. Even when my estimates were inaccurate—especially in M1 and M3—they still helped me plan and scope each task.  
In M1, estimates helped me clarify what needed to be done, even if I got the timing wrong.  
In M2, estimates helped me schedule tasks better and communicate timelines with my team.  
Even in M3, the process of estimating made me realize which parts I needed to learn better.

### 3. Was there any benefit to tracking actual effort on issues? What were the benefits or drawbacks of doing so?

Absolutely. Tracking actual effort helped me:  
- Reflect on where I spent the most time  
- Understand what types of tasks (coding, research, planning) took longer  
- Identify areas for improvement  

The only minor drawback was forgetting to track effort when interrupted or switching between tools.

### 4. How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you think your tracking was?

I used a stopwatch or manually recorded time logs.  
- Coding time was tracked during focused VSCode sessions.  
- Non-coding time (design, research, collaboration) was tracked using notes and rough intervals.  

My tracking became more accurate over time—especially by M2 and M3—within 5–10 minutes of real working time.

### 5. How much overhead was there in tracking your work? Did it take a lot of time or interfere with your project work?

At first in M1, it felt like extra overhead. But it quickly became a habit and only took seconds to maintain.  
In fact, it made me more mindful of distractions and better at managing time.  
By M2 and M3, it was fully integrated into my workflow and didn’t slow me down at all.

---

### Summary

- **M1:** I underestimated everything due to inexperience.  
- **M2:** I estimated better due to experience.  
- **M3:** I again underestimated effort due to unfamiliarity with Supabase.  

Despite the variance in estimate accuracy, both estimating and tracking effort improved my ability to plan, prioritize, and reflect.
