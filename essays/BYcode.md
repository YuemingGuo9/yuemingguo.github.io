*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

One of my friends asked the question earlier last week -- why is it so hard to be an officer for the student branch? Why is so hard compared to working at my on-campus job? This question came after he struggled a little with bookkeeping for the student organization.

Now I gave him the standard answer - being an officer of an organization requires that you manage your time between school and work. There isn't anyone telling you what to do. It's the answer any good mentor would give, and is mostly true.

But the more I though about it, the more I wondered to myself...damn that's a really great question; it's one that deserves some more thought. Most people I think stop at the answer I gave previously - he obviously isn't managing his time properly.

Here's what I think: the difficult things will always be difficult.

## In the context of programming

I'm interested in software engineering because it allows me to get an online job and is a promising industry. I love writing code and hope to master more programming languages ​​and development skills in the future, such as TypeScript, Python, and React.

In addition to code, I am also very interested in AI technology. I hope to learn machine learning and deep learning, and master tools such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, so that I can participate in AI projects and even develop my own intelligent system.

In the future, I hope to continue to improve my programming and AI capabilities to prepare for remote work. I believe that software engineering can bring me stable career development and allow me to create more valuable technical products.
