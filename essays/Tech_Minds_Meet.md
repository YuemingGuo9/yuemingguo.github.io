At a recent tech event, I had the privilege of engaging in in-depth discussions with industry experts and professors about career opportunities in Information and Computer Science (ICS), skill enhancement, and the necessity of pursuing a graduate degree. Through this experience, I gained a clearer understanding of my career path and received valuable advice.

During the event, I specifically sought insights from an experienced professor regarding the current job trends in the ICS field. He explained that ICS graduates have a wide range of career options, including software development, data analysis, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. He emphasized that the job market highly values candidates with strong programming skills and hands-on project experience. Companies tend to prefer engineers who can contribute immediately, making practical experience just as important as theoretical knowledge.
Regarding the necessity of a graduate degree, the professor provided a rational analysis. He stated that if my goal is to enter the software development industry—especially in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development—a graduate degree is not mandatory. Many companies prioritize practical skills and work experience over academic qualifications. However, if I am interested in artificial intelligence, data science, computer vision, or algorithm research, pursuing a graduate degree could provide deeper expertise and increase my chances of securing a position at a major tech company.

Additionally, he mentioned that certain high-level roles, such as machine learning engineers, data scientists, and computer systems architects, typically favor candidates with a master's or doctoral degree. However, for most software engineering positions, a bachelor's degree is sufficient to secure a good job.

The professor also advised me to actively participate in internships and open-source projects to enhance my hands-on experience. He emphasized that when reviewing resumes, employers often prioritize real-world coding experience, completed projects, and problem-solving abilities over GPA. He encouraged me to engage in coding competitions, contribute to open-source projects, and seek internships to strengthen my competitiveness in the job market.
