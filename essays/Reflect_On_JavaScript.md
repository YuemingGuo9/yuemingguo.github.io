This is my first time use TypeScript, It is easier to use TypeScript than C++ or Java.

And code hints are available for any code in the program, which provides a sense of security anytime and anywhere, and enhances the development experience.I think Typescript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective. It enables developers to express their intentions more clearly when writing code. For example, when using TypeScript, developers can define interfaces to describe the structure of objects, which makes the entire code easier to understand and maintain.
